    [F]
    there's a boy
                        [C7]
    letting his rattail grow
                            [G]
    and he's holding onto my banjo

    (same chords)
    there's a girl
    setting us all aglow
    she's only thinking about her pillow

    but they're not part of this song
    they both get their own songs
    and he can sing his own god damn song
    pretty well

    if i had to write her into this song
    we would probably run out of our alotted time
    pretty fuckin fast

    ++

    i was lyin
    what you heard on the radio
    i was talkin 'bout hypothetical
        ()

    start cryin
    watching the airplanes go
    pilots smokin out the window
        (but i won't, cause my light's, still on)

    he's a wood's hole, she's a deep spring
    they're a a box that you put your money in
    something boricua

    [instrumental]

    note the drop D
