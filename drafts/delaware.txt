i'm in love with the king king casey
'cause his friends are all cooler than me
i watched em throw their phones into the ocean
i asked why, they said happiness is e-sea

so i cruise around the palace in the gutters
if i'm caught, i'll say i'm looking for a job
TR bear slung around his shoulder
downstairs i'll be sweaty on the wall

had a bowl and a record deal
too fly
got a baby in the backseat
beat cop and a crimson sky

had a bowl and a record deal
too fly
