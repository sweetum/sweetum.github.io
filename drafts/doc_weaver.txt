[G]                                     [C]
close the door, you're in or out, just hurry
    [D]                             [G]
before the gust comes knocking up a storm
    [G]                                     [C]
make sure you're bundled up, don't want to worry
    [D]                 [C]         [G]
about having to bust out the old blowtorch

[G]

        [G]                             [D] [D7]

        [G]                             [D] [D7]
and the crazy things we see when we go down town
[G]                     [B7]
