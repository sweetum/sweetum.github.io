don't take
your life
until your lawyer shuts his mouth and begins to write

so kindle your journal and set your secrets alight
'cause we're all dead set on burning our american rites
i'm talking about cigarettes and gasoline,
tomatoes from the mezzanine
flaming up, approaching the star of the night

i'm talKing about -- true love, baby,
it's the one thing i don't got
that's not true either, but i'll say it for the song
