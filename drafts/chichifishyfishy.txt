don't take
your life
until your lawyer shuts his mouth and begins to write

please kindle your journal and set your e-ink alight
now we're all dead set on burning our american rites
i'm talking about cigarettes and gasoline,
tomatoes from the mezzanine
o bursting flames, descend on the star of the night

i'm talKing about -- true love, baby,
it's the one thing i don't got
that's not true either, but i'll say it for the song
