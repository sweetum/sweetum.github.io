<b>ideas worth looking into</b>
    + raspberry pi physical internet radio
        <i>
        plug into computer, react native app to set up list of web streams to tune through
        then battery operated -- dial knob to tune into different web streams as if real radio. 
        make very cute
        would go platinum in the MoMa design store
    </i>
    + technicolor replication iphone app
        <i>
        how funny would that be! but not too funny to not be a good concept! there are a lot of photo and ideo filter apps out there and they SHIT ASS. but not mine. mine will be good
    </i>
    + backlog
        <i>
        i have a handful of friends who are very poor texters, but maintain (breathlessly) that they do in fact care about the things i send them. yet, at a certain point, it becomes somewhat gauche to keep texting them links, articles, songs, etc and it becomes a stressor for them at how much they have to respond to. it’s also difficult to keep track of everything, and stuff gets lost! i think it would be cute if you and a friend could set up a backlog where instead of texting each other superfluous shit like youtube videos and spotify links and blah blah, like stuff that you have to actually engage with to respond, you can just drop it in your backlog and then when they have time they can see an aggregate list of everything that made the other person think of them :^) and then CLEAR IT OUT!

    + store
        <i>
        ughh i cant fucking explain this one in a way that does not take me THIRTY MINUTES but long story short a) i wish i had a niche-agnostic logging app like letterboxd or rateyourmusic or strava whatever where i could template my shit out and store it because i have so much shit i want to remember and keep track of and i do NOT want to make spreadsheets or just have a million notes documents. i really do think there’s something to this one. like, create your own niche, let’s say you’re tracking your cd collection. like i am. when you set it up, you can build your own template for what you log — so for the cd example i would like artist and album etc but also where i got it, how much i liked it, where in my shelf i’m classifying it, whether it would be good to take on a road trip WHATEVER and then whenever i listen to a cd i can log it with my own particularities.    and b) i think it would be really funny to be like yeah i work at Store

<b>funny ideas that are still worth looking into</b>
    + UUID dating site
        <i>
        when you sign up, you’re given a UUID. if you and another person’s UUID collide, you get to go on a date. and also like people might freak out  more of a silly joke than anything but i bet the shit heads on hacker news would get a kick out of it and give me a JOB
￼</i>
    + step dance directory animated 
        <i>
        contra dancing is soooo hard. i am so bad it’s embarrassing but i loooove to dance. i think it would be cool if there was a directory of common dances and their steps out there, and what would be Really cool if they could be visualized. it should be possible. well, everything’s possible. it should be reasonably doable. passion/preservation project
</i>

</i>
    + aDnB
