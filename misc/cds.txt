feist - the reminder
    stunningly delicate and jubilant. so good! sooooooo good. multiple times on
    the second half, a song will start and i'll think to myself, eesh, maybe 
    the first skip, and then i'll recognize where it's going and wordlessly castrate
    myself for my lack of faith in dear feist. one of the best from one of the best
stan getz - getz / gilberto
    a while ago, ty and i had a conversation about how will toledo (stick with me)
    is cursed by being such a monstrously talented songwriter that most of his songs
    could be a streaking masterpiece for any other artist, but for him, they're
    just another song. this doesn't really apply, but it's never surprising to me
    that this cd is *exactly* what i'm looking for when i turn it on. it's just 
    so good. i've doubtlessly come to take it for granted.
swinging hollywood hillbilly cowboys - cowboy & western
    quite odd. i enjoy playing weird background music when people come to tour
    the apartment i'm currently living in because it sets a strange game-like vibe,
    and this certainly did the trick.
swinging hollywood hillbilly cowboys - the hits
    also quite odd. i have a hard time believing these were all hits. some fun ones!
joan of arc - so much staying alive and lovelessness
    wrbb steal. label descrbes it as a lush & innovative masterpiece. pfftooey!
ani difranco - not a pretty girl
    brilliant. one of my favorite lyricists ever! she is so quick and sharp.
