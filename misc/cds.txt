** feist - the reminder
    thoughts:
        stunningly delicate and jubilant. so good! sooooooo good. multiple times on
        the second half, a song will start and i'll think to myself, eesh, maybe this is
        the first skip, and then i'll recognize where it's going and wordlessly castrate
        myself for my lack of faith in dear feist. one of the best from one of the best.
        i need to listen one hundred more times so i can remember which song is which.

        a while ago, ty and i had a conversation about how will toledo (stick with me)
        is cursed by being such a monstrously talented songwriter that most of his songs
        could be a streaking masterpiece for any other artist, but for him, they're
        just another song. this doesn't really apply, but it's never surprising to me
        that this cd is *exactly* what i'm looking for when i turn it on. it's just 
        so good. i've doubtlessly come to take it for granted.

** swinging hollywood hillbilly cowboys - cowboy & western

        quite odd. i enjoy playing weird background music when people come to tour
        the apartment i'm currently living in because it sets a strange game-like vibe,
        and this certainly did the trick.

        wrbb steal. i love compilation albums a lot. i wish there was still a market
        for them, but the thought of someone being willing to pay for a playlist
        is almost laughable in retrospect. of course, the core part of buying a compilation
        cd was being able to listen to the music -- still. i can never really get into 
        japanese rap. the whole thing is so early aughts.
