                                texas
just a whisper
and i'd tear up
wouldn't even have to know what you said
you say baby, that's the part that matters

as your knuckles gently graze my newport fontanelles

someowhere in the sea somewhere, i see us swimming, sailing, surfing side by side
pink clouds, a peach! the horizon's on my mind
fish swim past my ears, birds nibble at my feet
wind blows through my sails, thank you, taking me somewhere

just a whisper
and i'd say
i'm so lucky
you would think of me
you are a place
that i call home

                                johnny
johnny can't swim, but his parents always said he's enough
so we snuck him to the levy, where the holy see-saw Maiden Rough 
she said, give me your laylines, johnny
i'll tell you about what's in store

johnny wouldn't sink, but my brother made me call on his bluff
so we wrapped him in a blanket and we threw him in the back of our truck
i said, shiver til you're dry, johnny, here comes a glimpse of the sun

johnny got pissed, but we'd never let the kid shake us up
he said, "I HATE YOU!" and he fucked off in a dumb little fuss
we said, give us your laylines, what's wrong? 
i thought you said you're in love?
you knew it was me, johnny
gimme a smile, pucker up!

so, johnny, it's been great
and i wish that we could stay
despite your anal formalities
and total, utter, lack of a say

if i pour another drink
as i teeter on the brink
then i'll feel my eyes flutter, nice powers
oh, i'm feeling risque

well, i don't know what to say
but i know that you can't stay
you can come, you can go, you can linger, but you can't stay

no, i don't know what to say
but johnny, you can't stay
you can come, you can go, you can linger, but you can't stay

oh, i don't know
what to say to you
i've been feeling this way for a while
'bout a month or two
                    (but i didn't wanna tell ya, didn't wanna say)
i don't know
what i'm supposed to do
johnny, you're a bore, i've said it all before
but i've never really cared that much about anything, ty reynolds

johnny gotta go
johnny gotta go
can't go home
doesn't got a home
but johnny gotta go

johnny gotta go
johnny gotta go
can't come home
don't gotta home
but john, you gotta go

i should have held you when it counted
not just when i thought we looked good
and maybe, if you'd give me one more syllable
you'll see that i could
