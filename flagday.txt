just a whisper and i'd tear up
wouldn't even have to know what you said
you say baby, that's the part that matters
i ignore the siren's blare cause it makes me look kinda cool

someowhere in the sea somewhere, i see us swimming, sailing, surfing, maybe fucking side by side
pink clouds, a peach! the horizon's on my mind
fish swim past my ears, birds nibble at my feet
wind blows through my sails, thank you, taking me somewhere

just a whisper
and i'd say
i'm so lucky
you would think of me
you were a place
that i called home

                                Johnny
johnny can't swim, but his parents always said he's enough
so we snuck him to the levy, where the holy see-saw Maiden Rough 
she said, give me your laylines, johnny
i'll tell you about what's in store

johnny wouldn't sink, but my brother made me call on his bluff
so we wrapped him in a blanket and we threw him in the back of our truck
i said, shiver til you're dry, johnny, here comes a glimpse of the sun

    [instrumental]

johnny got pissed, but we couldn't let the kid shake us up
he said, "I HATE YOU!" and that was the last of him. 
we said, give us your laylines, what's wrong? 
didn't you said you're in love?
oh, you knew it was me, johnny
deep down, you got your hopes up!
she said, give me your laylines, johnny
i'll tell you about what's in store


    [just archie]
so, johnny, it's been great
and i wish that we could stay
despite your anal formalities
and total, utter, lack of a say




    oh, i don't know what to say
                                    no, i don't know what to say
    but i know that you can't stay
                                    but i know that you can't stay
    i'd be happy to write up a list of things to do
                                                    there's a lot to do in new brunswick!
    oh, i don't know what to say
                                    no, i don't know what to say
    but i know that you can't stay
                                    but i know that you can't stay
    you can come, you can go, you can linger but you can't stay
                                                                    
        here comes ty

    [instrumental]

oh, i don't know
what to say to you
i've been feeling this way for a while
'bout a month or two
                    (but i didn't wanna tell ya, didn't wanna say)
i don't know
what i'm supposed to do
johnny, you're a bore, i've said it all before
but i've never really cared that much about anything, ty reynolds

    [instrumental]

johnny gotta go
johnny gotta go
can't go home
doesn't got a home
but johnny gotta go

johnny gotta go
johnny gotta go
can't come home
don't gotta home
but john, you gotta go

we can talk it out like normal people
but you just wanna read about it

you like being scared
i like holding you

there's a sauna in my glove compartment
and i can't get to sleep without it

i like being scared
i like holding you

                                Texas (coda)
i should have held you when it counted
not just when i thought we looked good
and maybe, if you'd give me one more syllable
you'll see that i could

i should have held you when it counted
not just when i thought we looked good
                                    (but we did! oh, we looked so good!)
and baby, please, just give me one more syllable
                                            (AKH!)
you'll see why you

Give me some time and Iâ€™ll be back
My little baby brother Bobby got sacked
He says hes taking all his things and now the young boy says hes packed

Peace be With you and your spirit
Father I forgot the lyric
All your fleeting intimations give me
No reason to fear it

Peace be With you and your spirit
Father I forgot the lyric
All your fleeting intimations give me
No reason to fear it

Im afraid your city is Dead
And I watched you take your things to bed
My little baby brothers car got wrecked
I dont remember how it happened but it ate up all my checks

Peace be With you and your spirit
Father I forgot the lyric
All your fleeting intimations give me
No reason to fear it

Take my bags and
Go now 
Take my bags and 
go now

My grandchildren
Will Never
Know that you
Existed
I believe
In Mr. Grieves
Pray for man in the middle 
One that talks like Doolittle

Peace be With you and your spirit
Father I forgot the lyric
All your fleeting intimations give me
No reason to fear it   
Peace be With you and your spirit
Father I forgot the lyric
