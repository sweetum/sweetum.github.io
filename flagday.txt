texas
just a whisper
and i'd tear up
wouldn't even have to know what you said
you said baby, that's the part that matters


someowhere in the sea somewhere, i see us swimming, sailing, surfing side by side
pink clouds, a peach! the horizon's on my mind
fish swim past my ears, birds nibble at my feet
wind blows through my sails, thank you, taking me somewhere
