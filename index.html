    i got lost 
                                [G#m]
    but you should. . . stick around
    [G#m -> F#m walkdown]                       [B] 
    ‘cause they’re filming a new big dig all around downtown
            [E]
    he went soft (he went soft!)
                    [G#m]
    but it wasn't his fault (no it wasn't his fault!)
    [G#m -> F#m walkdown]                   Gmaj7       [B]

    in a little green space we threw up on and called our home 
        [A]                                        [Am]
    a plaid skirt smothered your eyelids, and you came

                    [A]
    we’re speaking like we’re friends but mother don’t bother
            [B]
    watch a car spinning out, shouting cool for the summer
            [A]
    as we're taking little bites of our collegiate lovers
                [B]                                             [A]

    “it’s a place full of lover lovers, they fuck for a cause,

            [A]                                 [E]
    it makes sense, it’s what our parents did before us.
            [A]                                 [Am]
    if you find it too hard to forgive her, lend it time

    in a few short years, we’ll all be gone.

                    [B]
    so with your lungs filling up in the scarlet school colors, 
        [A]
    you take a look back, notice none of it matters
        [B]
    in a week, it’s a wake, in another another, 
        [A]
    we’ve moved on to the boy from the live-action Heathers
            [B]                                             [A]
    and i’m shaking my hips as i watch the years go by      (24 25 26)

    i'm still in this fucking shirt, but the tips are running dry    (lemme see it, lemme see it lemme see it now)

    fingers dancing softly in the air 
    travel at high speeds across the ground
    but i just want to go
    
    i don’t know what you’re saying about me, but i hope it’s really nice
    something about how we used to touch our noses to each other, and move them side by side
    everyone’s looking, no one’s looking, it doesn’t really matter
    maybe my roommate’s looking, but he’s usually asleep 
    
    four in the morning, you touched me arm, asked to grab a cup of coffee
    i’d never tried it, i said yes, what’s the worst that could happen 
    maybe my love will indite me, maybe it’ll set me free
    maybe my love will indite me, maybe it’ll set me free
    but i just want to go
    
    siobhan said she’s not sad anymore, now she just feels tired
    she’s cold, she’s alone, she hates all of her opportunities
    i say, siobhan, i wish you’d take advantage of living in the big city
    she says, can we talk about something else? i feel like you’re emanating pity
    
    i’d like to write a book with her, something besides movies
    about a strip club with a fire pole, or a disassembled kitty
    maybe siobhan will ignite me, maybe she’ll let me see
    maybe my love will indite me, maybe it’ll sent me free
    but i just want to go

    [Gmin7] [Gsus something] [F]

    (well, i used to)
    slip and slide from work every day
    no breaks, high stakes, i had to pay
    you back
    IOU

    (then i)
    saw her working at the corner store
    milk shake, two straws, room for one more
    sat down
    said hey

    (she said!)
    get down! things are gonna get ugly!
    i'm looking for a guy who owes me money!
    not me. . . . for once. . . .

    man walks in, he looks like a giant
    chest hair so bold that you could lion it 
    he was shirtless
    i should mention that..

    we all keep talking, we all keep talking
    i look like a dream, but i sound like mclovin
    she's in a dry spell, she'll get laid all the time in heaven
    i went to budapest and it looked like new jersey
    i need to be killed by a gun so big it takes two guys to lift it
    and a third to pull trig as fast as he can, so he's calling his
    mom and she's calling his bluff, from the meadow where he grew up

        what's it like growing up in heaven, have you lost your mind?      the slant was red and all ours was mine

        all models are wrong, some are sorta useful
        i was looking for love, i was looking for love
        i was looking for you, and this is what i found

    (starting tempo)
    born in '68 into a tied-up elevator,
    i shimmied down the shaft, overeager for what comes later
    you're staring at my chin, i see defeat, bubbles rise, you lift your hand

    (faster)
    i'm wrapped around your pinky now, she's cognisant of what happened 
    when we slogged the crew down south into a den of laughs and childish
    fevers matching tempos kidsmoke drops the ball i'm chasing light until the
    bulls lower their horns and turn the siren on between us

    5. 6. 7. 8
    clap clap clap clap clap clap clap etc

    it's a risky time for searching in a field that's far too welcome 
    to a body or a skewer or at least someone who's held him
    close to making big decisions about phones and who's behind them
    in a rare and fragile state, i take a stab at setting fire to a pile

    (stacatto hits)

    [i live!] (i hope for so much longer)
    [i give!] (so i can go to heaven)
    [i die!] (curled on on the floor of a petstore)
    [i cry!] (curled on on the floor of a petstore  )

    i still need more to sate me, to elate me, consecrate me for the end

    [so if!] in a world that's far from perfect
    [that's it!] that's that, im PSH away
    [we've gone] to your house and explained our passions
    [to shit] after we've came

    around to the idea of a bloody anathema to a nonsensical scenario where i don't care to see ya!
