    travel at high speeds across the ground
    but i just want to go
    
    i don’t know what you’re saying about me, but i hope it’s really nice
    something about how we used to touch our noses to each other, and move them side by side
    everyone’s looking, no one’s looking, it doesn’t really matter
    maybe my roommate’s looking, but he’s usually asleep 
    
    four in the morning, you touched me arm, asked to grab a cup of coffee
    i’d never tried it, i said yes, what’s the worst that could happen 
    maybe my love will indite me, maybe it’ll set me free
    maybe my love will indite me, maybe it’ll set me free
    but i just want to go
    
    siobhan said she’s not sad anymore, now she just feels tired
    she’s cold, she’s alone, she hates all of her opportunities
    i say, siobhan, i wish you’d take advantage of living in the big city
    she says, can we talk about something else? i feel like you’re emanating pity
    
    i’d like to write a book with her, something besides movies
    about a strip club with a fire pole, or a disassembled kitty
    maybe siobhan will ignite me, maybe she’ll let me see
    maybe my love will indite me, maybe it’ll sent me free
    but i just want to go

    i don't know why, darling
    i don't know why
        [C]         
    but something
        [G]
    is wrong

    [G]
    i don't know why, nora
    i don't know why
        [C]         
    but something
        [G]
    is wrong

    cuz,
    [F]
    when you
        when you
            when you
                [G]
                wander home

    we
    [F]
    kiss you
            we hug you
                we tell you 
                    we love you
    [G]
    then you go

    [G]
    I tried to pry in your
    beautiful mind
            [C]
    but the shine of your eyes
                   [G]
    left me blind

    [G]
    feelings aside, nora
    you've bled us dry
         [C]
    but at least we can say that we
        [G]
    tried

    so,
    [F]
    when you
        when you
            when you
                [G]
                don't come home

    we'll
    [F]
    kiss you
            we'll hug you
                we'll tell you 
                    we love you
    [G]
    then we'll go

    [G]
    well, one day nora, she said to me
    i think it's time you let me roam free
    [C]                                [G]
    i said ok, ok ok, darling. . . let's not be hasty
    
    [G]
    she shot right up and the whole room shook
    it's bound to happen, but sure hard to look
    [C]                                         [G]
    there's no snake oil more slimy than a parenting book

    i ran to the door, said, "NORA, DON'T GO!"
    she juked me out and slammed the fly
    i said think about it, nora, please, what you're doing to me

    she said, if i wanted to stay home, i'd lick a knife
    i'd be bedridden, reliant, for the rest of my life
    you could love me, static, as you met me, hospitalized!



        
    ++

    you don't trust me
    and i don't like that

    you don't trust us, nora, but we still love you!

        everyone was beautiful, no one was horny
