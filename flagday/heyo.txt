                                Heyo
I dont remember how I went about it
But its Warm and oh I wish I had it
Though it Serves no purpose now Ive had it
And lord knows I cant live without it

Heyo! Heyo, heyo, heyo! Heyo heyo, heyo! Heyo heyo, heyo! Heyo
Sock it to me now
Heyo! Heyo, heyo, heyo! Heyo heyo, heyo! Heyo heyo, heyo! Heyo
Sock it to me now

I dont want it to let it get away from me
I hope you die a good death in your dreams
Tide of Freedom making everything seem
Yours
