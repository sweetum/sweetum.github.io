                                how to be a ball
grip your curve
he's one in a million
while the metermaid catches a blow intended for a pole
'cause you tried to bend, 
to swing, to bleed, to fall, to let, i get it

+ riff chorus + 

caress your face
what are those red lines on your cheeks, babe?
are they treating you right, are they teaching you how to be a ball?

cuz it's hard
it's hard
but you get softer, you get softer over time
but it's hard
it's hard
at the end of it all, to realize that you wanna be a ball

+ riff chorus + 

through a window
on a wardrobe                   
in my bedroom
is a mirror made in vietnam
ACKH!

you can see through
if she wants to
you know how to
and she wants you
TO

(repeat)

SHE WANTS YOU TO BE A FUCKING BALL
GOD MOTHERFUCKING DAMNIT HOLY SHIT
DID YOU SEE THAT?
VENOM DRIPPING FROM YOUR FANGS, IT'S A GENERATIONAL SLAM DUNK

+ noisy interlude +
