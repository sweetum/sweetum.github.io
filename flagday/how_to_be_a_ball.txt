                                How to Be a Ball
grip your curve
stats say you're one in a million
while a metermaid catches a blow intended for a pole
back's on the mend
you had to steal, we tried to bend
cried what if i fall?
said i really fucking hope you do

through a window
on a wardrobe                         
in my bedroom                         
is a mirror made in vietnam             
ACKH!                                  

you can see through                 
if she wants to                        
you know how to                      
and she wants you                   
TO

but if you let me shape you in the palm of my hand
then i promise you'll be 'round forever, oh

GOD MOTHERFUCKING DAMNIT HOLY SHIT

through the window
on my wardrobe
in my bedroom
is a mirror made in vietnam

and i don't know how to tell you that i broke it
yes i broke everything

in the window
on the wardrobe
in my bedroom
is a mirror made in vietnam

and i don't know how to tell you that i broke it
yes i broke it every time
