                                how to be a ball
grip your curve
he's one in a million
while the metermaid catches a blow intended for a pole
'cause you tried to bend, 
to swing, to bleed, to fall, to let, i get it

+ riff chorus + 

through a window
on a wardrobe                         it's hard
in my bedroom                         it's hard, but you get softer,
is a mirror made in vietnam             you get softer every time,
ACKH!       

you can see through                     but still, he cries, he begs,
if she wants to                        he pleads, he lies
you know how to                         cuz at the end of the day, sez
and she wants you                   all he wants is for you to be a fucking ball
TO

(repeat)

GOD MOTHERFUCKING DAMNIT HOLY SHIT
DID YOU SEE THAT?
VENOM, VENOM DRIPPING FROM YOUR FANGS, IT'S A GENERATIONAL SLAM

+ noisy interlude + 

through the window
on my wardrobe
in my bedroom
is a mirror made in vietnam

AND I DON'T KNOW HOW TO TELL YOU THAT I BROKE
YES I BROKE EVERYTHING
