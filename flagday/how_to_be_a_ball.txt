                                how to be a ball
grip your curve
he's one in a million
while the metermaid catches a blow intended for a pole
'cause you tried to bend, 
to swing, to bleed, to fall, to let, i get it

+ riff chorus + 

through a window
on a wardrobe                         it's hard
in my bedroom                         it's hard, but you get softer,
is a mirror made in vietnam             you get softer every time
ACKH!

you can see through
if she wants to                     
you know how to
and she wants you
TO

(repeat)

SHE WANTS YOU TO BE A FUCKING BALL
GOD MOTHERFUCKING DAMNIT HOLY SHIT
DID YOU SEE THAT?
VENOM DRIPPING FROM YOUR FANGS, IT'S A GENERATIONAL SLAM

+ noisy interlude +
