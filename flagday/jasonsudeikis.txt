								Jason Sudeikis
I had this dream once
Where Vince vaughn and Jason sudekis
Made the greatest buddy comedy movie of all time

And I bet you could think of
Every single time that I made up
Some stupid thing I wanted to say that was a lie

And I think my hand hurts
From when I broke it at a concert
And I never ever went to the doctor But ill be fine

So I take it easy
Cause what’s one more bad season
I want to say its in there but its out of the light

There’s a man over there 
But i don’t really know if you can see
He’s got a faucet where 
You would think his torso should be

He walks around town
With a cane and a sheet of a paper
He tries to sell his head to every other stranger

And I swear I read it
Cause you said you thought I didnt get it
And I dont put up much of a fight cause you are right

Call me when it happens
And I will have the same reaction
When I saw that movie blade with Wesley snipes

And he takes the train now
And he thinks hes being framed now
But even his father thinks that its all he knows

So dont ever say that
It isn’t worth getting a paycheck
Cause every other day you cry and so it goes

well good morning to my man
You look a little long in the tooth
But I saw you yesterday when you shuffle on your roof
