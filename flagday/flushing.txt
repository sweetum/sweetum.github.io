                                Ghost
1,2,3,4

Now that the headmasters abroad
All your visions are gone
Forget all their outlandish songs
And accept all their points as wrong

A stupid pony with a shaggy hide
Your all but forced to abide
A thousand pricks come filled with pride
Im far from it but I tried

There is no Ghost
He hasn't washed his ass in a year  x2
There is no ghost
Indifference comes from the rear

                                                x2

At some points
You may find it will burn
And if you
Ever had any butter
You would have
Given it to your neighbor
                                AND 
We would have                       NOW
Made it out of jfk                  YOUR FUEL'S RUNNING LOW
I give you
Every piece of my word              SO A FOCUSED HAND WILL GUIDE YOU
That i am
Better at it now                TO FOLLOW THROUGH YOUR THROE
And that counts
For what                        TIL YOU CALL
You want                    AND SAY, WE'VE GOTTA GO
                        AND BABY, I'LL BELIEVE YOU
It to count for     I HOPE I CAN BELIEVE YOU
