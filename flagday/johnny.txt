                                Johnny
johnny can't swim, but his parents always said he's enough
so we snuck him to the levy, and we took him to see Maiden Rough
she said, give me your laylines, johnny
i'll tell you about what's in store

johnny wouldn't sink, but my brother made me call on his bluff
so we wrapped him in a blanket and we threw him in the back of our truck
i said, shiver til you're dry, johnny, after that, i don't want to hear a peep out of you

    [instrumental]

johnny got pissed, but we couldn't let the kid shake us up
he said, "I HATE YOU!" and he stomped off in a stupid little fuss
we said, give us your laylines, what's wrong? 
i thought you said you're in love
oh, you knew it was me, johnny
deep down, i know you got your hopes up!
she said, give me your laylines, johnny
she'll tell you about what's in store

    [just archie]
so, johnny, it's been great
we've had such a lovely day
despite your presence being so overbearing
i feel like i could scream

    oh, i don't know what to say
                                    no, i don't know what to say
    but i know that you can't stay
                                    but i know that you can't stay
    i'd be happy to write up a list of things to do
                                                    there's a lot to do in new brunswick!
    oh, i don't know what to say
                                    no, i don't know what to say
    but i know that you can't stay
                                    but i know that you can't stay
    you can come, you can go, you can linger but you can't stay
                                                                    
        here comes ty

    [instrumental]

oh, i don't know
what to say to you
i've been feeling this way for a while
'bout a month or two
                    (but i didn't wanna tell ya, didn't wanna say)
i don't know
what i'm supposed to do
johnny, you're a bore, i've said it all before
but i've never really cared that much about anything, ty reynolds

    [instrumental]

johnny gotta go
johnny gotta go
can't go home
doesn't got a home
but johnny gotta go

johnny gotta go
johnny gotta go
can't come home
don't gotta home
but john, you gotta go
