                                Johnny
johnny can't swim, 'cause his parents always said he's enough
so we snuck him to the levy, and we took him to see Maiden Rough
she said, give me your laylines, johnny
she'll tell you about what's in store

johnny wouldn't sink, but my brother made me call on his bluff
so we wrapped him in a blanket and we threw him in the back of our truck
i said, shiver til you're dry, johnny, after that, i don't want to hear a peep out of you

    [instrumental]

johnny got pissed, but we couldn't let the kid shake us up
he said, "I HATE YOU!" and uhh that was the last we saw of him, to be honest


    oh, i don't know what to say
                                    no, i don't know what to say
    but i know that you can't stay
                                    but i know that you can't stay
    i'd be happy to write up a list of things that you could do
                                                    there's a lot to do in new brunswick!
    oh, i don't know what to say
                                    no, i don't know what to say
    but i know that you can't stay
                                    but i know that you can't stay
    you can come, you can go, you can linger but you can't stay
                                                                    
        here comes ty

    [instrumental]

oh, i don't know
what to say to you
i've been feeling this way for a while
'bout a month or two
                    (but i didn't wanna tell ya, didn't wanna say)
i don't know
what i'm supposed to do
johnny, you miserable piece of shit, 
i really hope you die
ty reynolds, everybody!
