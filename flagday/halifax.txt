                                Halifax

1, 2, 3, 4, 1 Tryna make it to Halifax
Give me some time and Iâ€™ll be back
My little baby brother Bobby got sacked
He says hes taking all his things and now the young boy says hes packed

Peace be With you and your spirit
Father I forgot the lyric
All your fleeting intimations give me
No reason to fear it
Peace be With you and your spirit
Father I forgot the lyric
All your fleeting intimations give me
No reason to fear it

Im afraid your city is Dead
And I watched you take your things to bed
My little baby brothers car got wrecked
I dont remember how it happened but it ate up all my checks

Peace be With you and your spirit
Father I forgot the lyric
All your fleeting intimations give me
No reason to fear it
Peace be With you and your spirit
Father I forgot the lyric
All your fleeting intimations give me
No reason to fear it

Take my bags and 
Go now 
Take my bags and 
go now

My grandchildren
Will Never
Know that you
Existed
I believe
In Mr. Grieves
Pray for man in the middle
One that talks like Doolittle

1,2,3,4,1,2 Peace be With you and your spirit
Father I forgot the lyric
All your fleeting intimations give me
No reason to fear it
Peace be With you and your spirit
Father I forgot the lyric
All your fleeting intimations give me
No reason to fear it
