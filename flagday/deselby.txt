                                Deselby
Deselby takes his shoes
To the gym
For his mens league basketball
He laces them up with aplomb 
He doesnt want any trouble with the refs today
He feels the eyes of them all
He got these shoes at the foot locker next to the cvs next to the Dairy Queen
At the Newport mall
He spends his days there after going to target
And the liberty science center with the stars that shine so very tall

Bird go sqwuak and caw
And it chirps and it screech
Bird go peter Peter Peter
And owl go hoot and I sneeze
Bird go warble warble 
And cockadoodoodle doo 
While up in the trees
Bird go twitter tweet 
Out of its beak
While it eats seeds

Dear mr deselby I dont want you anywhere around me ever again
And dont you ever pretend that you didnt go and lose your got damn mind
I hope it burns you till the end I hope it fills your days with dread
But you’ll be cool to all your friends yeah you’ll be cool to all your friends
