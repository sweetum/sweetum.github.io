                                Hi Beems!

this is a flag day song now. 
check flag day out at

i got lost 
but you should. . . stick around
‘cause they’re filming a new big dig all around downtown
he went soft (he went soft!)
but it wasn't his fault (no it wasn't his fault!)
he promised this had never happened before      (oh god. . . i’m sorry) 

9 fell in place
no sex excess success
in a little green space we threw up on and called our home 
a plaid skirt smothered your eyelids, and you came
an arm’s length from heaven
                   
(but) when the night time comes and it’s you or the others
we’re speaking like we’re friends but mother don’t bother
watch a car spinning out, shouting cool for the summer
as we're taking little bites of our collegiate lovers
aaaand i’m shaking my hips as i watch the years go by    (21 22 23!)
she’s counting her tips as the boys race to say hiiiii      (kill the boy. kill the boy 
                                                                                            in the green tie.)
hand josh the map
he loves giving directions 
said right, went left
jersey slide, two frets
i said, “where are we going? where are you taking us?” 
he didn’t answer — you said,
“it’s a place full of lover lovers, they fuck for a cause, 
and they told me that we should join them, do you think so too?” 

at the same spots, we’re all sixteen, but everyone’s thirty now
it makes sense, it’s what our parents did before us.
if you find it too hard to forgive her, lend it time
in a few short years, we’ll all be gone.

so with your lungs filling up in the scarlet school colors, 
    [A]
you take a look back, notice none of it matters
    [B]
in a week, it’s a wake, in another another, 
    [A]
we’ve moved on to the boy from the live-action Heathers
        [B]                                             [A]
and i’m shaking my hips as i watch the years go by      (24 25 26)
    [B]                                                    [A]
i'm still in this fucking shirt, but the tips are running dry    (lemme see it, lemme see it lemme see it now)
