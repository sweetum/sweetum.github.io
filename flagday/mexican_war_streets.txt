                                Mexican war streets

Im going down
Down to the Mexican war streets

Dont stop me babe
Youâ€™ll miss me by the skin of your teeth

Im gonna die now
And this whole damn things coming with me

I will make it above
I will go about it swiftly

I think the house is on fire
Mother its just the northern lights
I think the house is on fire tonight

And I cant look at the rings of Saturn anymore
I cant look at the rings of Saturn anymore
I cant look at the rings of Saturn anymore
I cant look at the rings of Saturn anymore
