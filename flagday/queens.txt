i live in awe of the king, king casey
cuz his friends are all cooler than me
one night, they threw their phones into the ocean
i asked why, they said happiness is e-sea

so i cruise around the gutters in the palace
with a gleam in my eyes and a perk
hoping that i catch the king, king casey
and he lifts me up and puts me to work
