Burning
IMG

it's my most trusted regulars running up on deck
diving into shallow water -- what's going on these days?
you want to go get lit, like something new
massage chair deathbed, drifting off, watching ads for new pet food


don't take
your life
until your lawyer shuts his mouth and begins to write

please kindle your journal and set your e-ink alight
now we're all dead set on burning our american rites
i'm talking about cigarettes and gasoline,
tomatoes from the mezzanine
o bursting flames, descend on the star of the night

i'm talKing about -- true love, baby,
it's the one thing i don't got
that's not true either, but i'll say it for the song
