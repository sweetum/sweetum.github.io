Burning
IMG

it's my most trusted regulars running up on deck
diving into shallow water -- what's going on these days?
you want to go get lit, like something new
massage chair deathbed, drifting off, watching ads for new pet food


don't take
your life
until your lawyer shuts his mouth and begins to write

please kindle your journal and set your e-ink alight
now we're all dead set on burning our american rites
i'm talking about cigarettes and gasoline,
tomatoes from the mezzanine
o bursting flames, descend on the star of the night

i'm talKing about -- true love, baby,
it's the one thing i don't got
that's not true either, but i'll say it for the song



burning

i'm  -- drowning! the land's down once again
i tried loretta's, but i couldn't get down with her friends


write about the things we want to / start playing more stupid games

i'll whittle my journal and set your kindle alight / call her so hung up on burning your american rites / i'm talking about cigarettes and gasoline, tomatoes from the mezzanine / bursting seedlings, orbiting the star of the night

i'm talking 'bout cigarettes, fresh gasoline, seedlings from the mezzanine, tomatoes, bursting, bloodied it'srhe star of the night, burning

i'm  -- drowning! the land's down once again
i tried loretta's, but i couldn't get down with her friends

i'd like to start a movement with my voice
i'd like to start a movement of my legs towards yours
i'd like to start a movement of divorce
i'd like to get divorced
but the choice is yours

because i'm burning
but i'm not fire
and i'm not hot

i'm burning
it's like a fever
you're in my dreams a lot

i wanna see you naked
i want to smell your clothes
i wanna see you smile with your mouth wide open
and i want to blow your nose

i want to see you vibrate
i want to call you when it snows
i wanna see you dancing with some other guys
and i want them to know

i've gone to see margot and vince at the midnight parade, oh yeah

i wanna be your rabbi
i wanna fall for your ghost
i wanna watch you get married
and bum rush the altar with intent to propose

i wanna take your achoos
i wanna pay to see your shows
where i'll be dancing with some other guys
who could never hope to know

i've see margot and vince at the midnight parade, oh yeah

-> TY4DM

-> Burning again

1. i'll only ever try to start a fire without a light
2. i'll freeze my rice and never let it become poison overnight
3. if my hair grows long, i'll only ever cut it if that's somethign you would like
4. if i gotta stop burning, i won't go down without a fight

4. i will always make sure my kids get enough sleep
