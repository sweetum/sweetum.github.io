								Rhode Island
So you go on keep doing that
Keep things idling inside until the twenty second mile
And then we’ll sleep until all the papers reamed

I cant tell whats in your eyes but he looks like a machine
And then we’ll try to find the ceilings with the wood
But any practice that weve tried never turns out any good
Become a part of something that you cant explain
Your friends are far from perfect and theres nothing left to claim

Ohhhhhhhhhh Oh
Ohhhhhhhhhh Oh
Go To the  Store
Somewhere In Rhode Island
I think I knew
What you would say then

So say goodbye
To EVERY OTHER Monday
When you pass him getting gas just know you’ll get it one day

It makes no difference
If you ever get elected
Johns out in the corner and hes trying to make an exit

Ill Take your car
Moving westward on a high way
He wont know where his head is when he gets to being my age

So ill go leak
Beneath a steady bridge
Look how far ive come from a very sturdy hedge

Ohhhhhhhhhh Oh
Ohhhhhhhhhh Oh
Go To the  Store
Somewhere In Rhode Island
I think I knew
What you would say then
