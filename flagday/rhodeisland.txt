								Rhode Island
So you go on keep doing that
Keep things idling inside until the twenty second mile
And then we’ll sleep until all the papers reamed

I cant tell whats in your eyes but he looks like a machine
And then we’ll try to find the ceilings with the wood
But any practice that weve tried never turns out any good
Become a part of something that you cant explain
Your friends are far from perfect and theres nothing left to claim

Ohhhhhhhhhh Oh
Ohhhhhhhhhh Oh
Go To the  Store
Somewhere In Rhode Island
I think I knew
What you would say then
