								Juliette's Point
Going down the road with a case of rolling rock in my hand
Im out of darts and my lungs still hurt but im going to see my band
My car broke down in Arkansas and im hoping I see a van
No one speaks my language anymore but I listen to it when I can

We came here to start a fire but you cried cause it wouldnâ€™t burn
Somewhere down in Jacksonville I asked you where it hurt
I hope one day you make it and raise a mountain out of the earth
Youre scared of coming home ever since the day that was your birth

Dont let the girl with the cone on her head see you cry
Take all the time and get all of the dirt from your eye

Let The sunshine
Let the sunshine in x2
The sunshine in

"one more time"

let the sunshine
let the sunshine in
the sunshine in
