                                Anti-Johnny
There was the roar of the hybrid engine
And I told you that I dont know
And its not even worth a mention
How many times she went home

I tore up your mothers license plate
I’ll tell your PO that this time
She knows i can’t keep my story straight
So we’re lucky he’s a family a guy

Bobby left the other day for Cleveland
And hes my best friend
I never told him you were leaving
Im sure hell find out in the end

We put up 900 hundred something dollars
Cause every day I ride a horse
Saint JFR can get out of a ticket
If you see him at the golf course

Chorus:
This slim Jim is making a 
martyr out of me
And Resurrections are never 
how you think they’ll be

And im sorry Archie
But ive been drinking again
Me and the old man graham got us a head start on the weekend

And I’ll take every card in the deck
And i will throw them at the wall
wait around and make big sounds at who forgives me come next fall
