        SLOWER!
        set up synth
        figure out what exactly to do with horns. i don't love the current setup, it sounds just a little too ska

        keep beat much more steady, especially in the intro. keep beat completely steady on the instrumental, on the verse only do kick changes in the second half once the shaker is in (if at all)

        you should do some cute redux of the intro guitar line during the verse
    jonathan    
        you should play the same thing as me for the first half of each verse, then do your thing for the second half of each verse.

        just needs more practice and figuring out form. i think i want to go a little bit more towards the demo for the first run around and then second go more free
        archie and jackson switch instruments WOOHOO!

bar love
    horns
        going to ask you three to arrange a definitive form for how you're working the choruses of the first verse, with improvisation/dynamic control. only requirement is that you hit the slide-ish from G->A on the first note

intro / body / hips
    overall
        need countermelody on intro. kel used to improv around. will figure something out for aki. 
        make sure horns have precise plan for body
