            going to shift pt 2 to sound more like demo
            
            all cut out with John is so awesome, even more awesome if we can come back in without a drum kick just nods and vibes

            need someone to do lyrics with me during pt.2. emma maybe? or jonathan. or both!

            check out 'hips end praccy' on untitled and the end of 'hips alley'

            find better tone (with instrument presets/bass treble) for your motif (all sections)

            don't love the harmonizing in pt1, maybe it's a tone thing. let's figure that out

            make sure to hit the triplet in the walkdown on the pt3 line (ask me about this at practice)
            
            during pt3, if we're getting sparse, cut out the left hand for a bit

            play around with random licks during <if i knew, . . that it'd break your heart> section

        jackson
            have fun with fills etc on pt3 but try to keep a steadier 1 & 3 kick snare beat, don't deviate from that too much

        melody
            figure out what you want to do for pt.1, re-learn the written pt.3 bassline

        jonathan
            sax solo to the stars. hone that shit

        caleb
            this one goes for jonathan too:
        
            in pt.2, don't play for the first two full loops around the chords, then come in with the motif from pt.1
                motif
                motif
                harmonized motif
                harmonized motif

            at the end of pt.2, after the breakbeats, when i'm singing the motif along, it goes
                motif  
                motif
                motif
                harmonized motif    

        emma
            figure out good trumpet harmonies for the main motifs with caleb & jon

        aki
            we're going to write a part for you for pt.1, you're going to be somewhat the center of attention
            or at least the central melody of pt.1
            pt.2 you're droning with melody
            pt.3 you're improvising plucking or playing the bassline
    bar love
        overall
            want to make specific exquisite arrangement for pt.2 end after guitar interlude

            instrumental intro

            *learn the timing of the background vocals.*

        taryn
            check out 'bar love praccy' to see what i think our best take for you in pt.1 is
            keep drone going with pitch bends/volume changes on pt.2

        caleb
            nothing baby
        
        jonathan
            leave improvising to caleb in pt.1

        emma
            leave improvising to caleb in pt.1
            arrange a part for pt.2

            sounds awesome. 
            everyone who's playing it don't forget the
                +
            + +   +     +   line during the bridge. you can figure out what that means. think of it as the derivative of the actual line
                     + 

        aki
            we're writing you a fast part so get ready

            wheeeeee

            at a certain point it will no longer be cute that i call out the chords before i hit them in pt.2 try to remember em
        
        aki
            we're writing you a fast part for the end but besides that just slam that shit
        
        caleb
            said this during practice but definitely get more superfluous with your sax flourishes during verse
        
        jackson
            you and i should spend a minute on the transition until the final part
            you're hitting fills during the vocals of pt.5
            (beat beat beat   beat beat)    (fill)
                                             ayuhuasca ryder cellar!        etc
