bar love
+ 4/4 section
    + jam instrumental intro
    + let's try to be more precise with our noodling during the chorus, shouldn't have both people noodling at once. maybe step forward if you want to go.
    + try to evoke the sound of a slide from a G to the A, like
        --3s5-3---3s5-3------
        ----------------1----

+ 3/4 section
    + jon part mirror emma part for first half of each interlude, then do the new part+ everyone saying verse during guitar picked interlude at almost end
    + after guitar picked interlude, do arranged parts but a little bit faster/more frenetic
    + i'm going to say "you have my permission to lose it" and everyone's going to go ape shit

open/body/hips
+ open
    + emma: scrap the 12 10 12 etc bassline part. we stick to the low end methinks
    + jon: after doing your arranged part a little bit, do a slow dramatic improvised movement. like the part kel is playing in the recording in the untitled demo. lmk if i should elaborate
+ body
    + taryn love the keys bloops during the B part (if i knew. . that i'd break your heart etc)
    + jon when you're playing the main motif during the shout along don't do the raised motif, do something improvised every other. again lmk if you want an elaboration
+ hips
    + taryn start in high octave without low end ya
    + refer to hips end in untitled demos for a really great recording

in the mood
+ just learn ya part!
