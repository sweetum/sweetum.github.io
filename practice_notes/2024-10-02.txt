10/6 agenda
    practice for 10/12 set! setlist currently undecided.

past few practices notes
    angel hair
        love. beautiful song. i think we should incorporate the whistling that jackson and i did on 9/29 somehow. 
        aki listen to 9/15 angel hair and try to remember the part they had you play. it was pretty!
        love the brief surf rock E tremolo transition into angel hair fast part. wasn't sure about it but i think it's good.
