agenda
    anyone who did not bring a shirt to get stamped on 15th please do so! or if anyone wants a new shirt stamped. or perhaps an item. you'll come to notice that a significant portion of the items in this house have sweetums stamps on them. shappy day!

    we don't have any covers! we have no covers under our belt! we've played covers, we've held covers, but they've never made their way under our belts. as such, 09-18 is a designated covers day. just fuck around and play some songs we like.

    if you'd like to pitch a cover, please text it and i'll update this document. as it stands, please listen to the following songs before practice:

    archie : ribs
        archie - bass
        jagzin - drums
        taryn - keys
        caleb, melody, jonathan - saxophone
        emma - trumpet
        aki - cello

        i have a vision i have a vision i have a vision put your faith in me
    jonathan : all my friends
        just listen to the song dont even think about playing it. dont even think about it. i have an idea
    jackson : together again
        "caleb" "has" an "arrangement"

    random todos:
        hips
            caleb play high harmony instead of taryn
            add oooos/verse to intro
        slip & slide
            aki kel part
        ank 
            aki part (humming voice memo)
