    Wake up, you wanna save the world
    You and your sweet savior girl
    She’s the apple, you’re the Pearl
    You can’t believe you’re never dying 

    Your world shimmers but it never glows
    Things pass the only way they know
    Here you come, you’d like to know it too
    Well, who could say you aren’t trying?

    As you make a cup with your hands
    We’d all like to understand 

    But that my friend, that was a delusion of grandeur
    Cause you are not the only one who’s dreamt of being someone else
    Relax, my friend, you can only grab what yer handed
    And you are not the only one who’s ever had to ask for help

    You can’t remember when you made this place
    So every time we run this wicked race
    If I had another way to you
    I wouldn’t force you to deny me

    Your room is fading goin black and white
    When something speaks to you from out of sight
    Am I real, do I have your right?
    And are you sure you aren’t trying?

    And when you wake, I’ll be right here
    There is no path to walk in fear

    Cause that my friend, that was a delusion of grandeur
    Cause you are not the only one who’s dreamt of being someone else
    Relax, my friend, you can only grab what yer handed
    And you are not the only one who’s ever had to ask for help

    When you wake, I’ll be right here
