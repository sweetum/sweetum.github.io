    i open my eyes, and it's much darker than i remember
    i guess that's what i get for only coming around here in the winter

    i say your eyes are glowing amber ember, 
    you said i could've seen em shine if i'd been around at all last summer
    
    (instrumental)
    and i hate how you lament, 'cause you're my clementine
    a joke that only some of you will get, but i won't cut the line
    it's fine
    only thing is, i'll never know if you still trust me otherwise

    you were born in a place that is unfamiliar to me
    i'd like to see it
    maybe i could visit

    with a face full of scorn and an overwhelming urge to pee
    i think we could make it
    albeit shaken

    you'll be around
    and i'll be around
    and i'm gonna see you soon
