    [D] [G] x2

                  [Bm]
    oh, well, aye aye
    [D]         [G]
    i've got it made
        [Bm]           [D]      [G]
    in a 24-hour post-symbiotic state
                    [Bm]
    can't catch your eye
    [D]               [G]
        can't catch a break
        [Bm] 
    but at least i got this 
    [D]             [G]
    nifty new keychain

        [A]     [A7]
    and lately
              [Bm]                [D]           [G]
    i've been feeling my body is heavier than my mind
            [A]     [A7]
    and lately 
             [F#]               [G]        [Gm]
    i've been wishing you were mine

        [D]  [G]
    aye aye
    you've got it wrong
    i'm just jokin
    (gimme dat)

    (same chords for verse 2)

    i wish you'd call
    just to say hey!
    dishwashing job in old big pine CA (so far away!)
    i know i'm old
    it's in my face
    my wrinkled eyes and laughs betray my age

    and lately
    i've been feeling my body is heavier than my mind
    oh, baby

        [D]  [G] x2
    aye aye
