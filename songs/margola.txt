    Let it float, call it sold
    ain't nothing left but a heart of gold

    and it sure ain't safe to swim
        [G7] [C]

    Over, under, torn asunder
    sailor surrender, was a boring blunder

    [D7/D#]         [D#7/E]

    [C]
    as we mope, along the road,
    a big gust of wind blows us overboard

    [D7/D#]         [D#7/E] 
    and the highway's got some teeth
        [G7] [C]

    light white bags filled with all our crap

            [G7] [C]
    i'll take the raft

    [C]
    floating right burning bright
    said margola sinking into the night

    [D7/D#]         [D#7/E] 
    it's fire above, below
        [G7]   [C]
    kel told me so
