    [F]
    ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

    i don't know what the chords that aren't F are called
    so i'm gonna call them chord 2 and chord 3
    this entire section of the song


    [F]     [chord 2]   [chord 3]   [chord 2] (repeated)
    we all keep talking, we all keep talking
    i look like a dream, but i sound like mclovin
    she's in a dry spell, she'll get laid all the time in heaven
    i went to budapest and it looked like new jersey
    i need to be killed by a gun so big it takes two guys to lift it
    and a third to pull trig as fast as he can, so he's calling his
    mom and she's calling his bluff, from the meadow where he grew up

    [C]
    if i knew
                        [Bb]
    that it'd break your heart
                        [C]               
    then i'd never have sent it
                            [Bb]
    how much space is there left?

    [C]
    if i knew
                        [Bb]
    that it it would kill you
                        [C]
    then i'm asking again
                            [Bb]
    how much space is there left?

    (i don't know. that's ok. instead,)

    (archie's)                                                     
    we all keep talking, we all keep talking                           
    i'm singing what racecar ya-ya's shouldve been                     
    she's in love with bruce springsteen, doesn't fuck with the boss   
    i believe action is taken as result of this survey                 
    i can't call you, you have to call me                              
    what's it like growing up in heaven, have you lost your mind?      
    i'll have a phi gamma melta, NO BANANA PEPPERS!                    
    i believe in croco-mom, i think it would be funny! 
    you told me you loved me, but barely even fucked me               
    i've been feeling like shit lately, natalie portman
    everyone was beautiful, no one was horny
    true love is like nothing, it's like breathing air
    we're just normal men, henry don't get scared
    i can hear it call for me, shout so distinctly that
    the purpose of a system is what does
    hang with all of the sisters from punch drunk love
    the best actors can't have any other job in the world
    all models are wrong, some are sorta useful
    i was looking for love, i was looking for love
    i was looking for you, and this is what i found
    have you seen a kid about this tall in a red suit?
    the end of these work but not the beginning
    in a long shirt only if it's real nice in heaven
    the slant was red and all ours was mine
    he punched the wall so hard, it broke his fingers, hand, and wrist
    to carry the c, like adam levine
    drive that tractor straight up to heaven
    the bowl's full of hot water, water, and warm
    we all keep talking, we all keep talking
    i need to be killed by a gun so big it takes two guys to lift it
    and a third to pull trig as fast as he can, so he's calling his
    mom and she's calling his bluff, from the meadow where he grew up
