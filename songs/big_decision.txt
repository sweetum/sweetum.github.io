    (intro instrumental)
    [D  *   A   G]
    [A  *   G   *]

            [D]
    we were walking
                [A]
    to parks and back
    [Em]
    you with your guitar presets
    [G]
    me with the knife in my back

    [same chords]
    i did all the talking
    but i didn't talk
    you were the quiet glue
    and i was the rock

    [D]
    i didn't know
            [A]
    how to cut my slack
    [Bm]
    i was a fool
    [G]
    and i was hack

    you divided us into groups
    and our names were:

    *

    [D]
    [smart motherfuckers]

    [A]
    [wild bunch]

    [C]
    [pretentious]

    [G]
    [***]

    [D]
    [max and josh have an argument] (high D)
    
    [A]
    [relatively normal people] (high D)

    [C]
    [you guys call each other names the entire time]

    [G]
    [this is the lovers' area. . ]

    [Gm]

    *

    sometimes i forget why i came here
    i brought my guitar upstairs
    you gave me no choice and no quarter
    i had to grow my hair

    and then i dismembered the memories
    while i'm slouching in my lair
    i took my guitar to the party
    and i just left it there

    we prayed for air conditioning
    the beast just wouldn't die
    we thought it was dead when we cut off it its head
    you looked me in the eye, and you said

    you're invited
    embrace the good man twins
    do you know how long i've been trying to get us all in one place?
    i wanna see all the

    *

    [D]
    [smart motherfuckers]

    [A]
    [wild bunch]

    [C]
    [pretentious]

    [G]
    [and MEG!]

    [D]
    [max and josh have an argument] (high D)
    
    [A]
    [relatively normal people] (high D)

    [C]
    [you guys call each other names the entire time]

    [G]
    [THIS IS THE LOVERS' AREA]

    jam instrumental

    (outro)
    
    and
    [Dmaj7]
    you may find your body
        [D7]
    is heavier than your mind
        [G]                            [G/F#]
    and you may cede your company to prophets made of light
        [Em]
    in easy times you say you feel it
        [A]
    baby, i do too
        [Em]
    it's that sinking feeling
        [A7]
    that sinking feeling again

        [Dmaj7]                         [D7]
    so if your yellow teleprompter's running out of lines
        [G]                            [G/F#]
    just immerse yourself in cultures with nonlinear senses of time
        [Em]
    some call it margot (margot) heaven
        [A]
    'cause the patterns are so clear
        [Em]
    when your sinking feeling
        [A7]
    is that sinking feeling again
