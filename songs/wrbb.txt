    aki walked into a supermarket shop, you know,
    [E]                             [E]     [A]
    the ones that sell fruit in a self-serve cup
    they took a look at her cart, screamed, and rang the bell
    it was an all-hands-meeting staffed by neer-do-wells
    she got 36 pies, arnold palmer to go, and a half-eaten cashew
    rounding up the total to 600 dollars, (baby) not a cent more,
    charge it to WRBB one oh four point

    there were bags holding buckets made of boxes made of bins all
    stacked on her head hands nose and chin
    standing still as a scarecrow, my waiter my waiter
    overloaded, unexpected and i never forgave her
    fore she moved for the door four and off came her crown
    a landslide, manager's 600 down to 
    new alimony, you knew all our money goes to
    WRBB one oh four point
