    [B]                 [A] 
    aki walked into a supermarket shop, you know,
    [E]                             [E]     [A]
    the ones that sell fruit in a self-serve cup
    they took a look at her cart, screamed, and rang the bell
    it was an all-hands-meeting staffed by neer-do-wells
    she got 36 pies, arnold palmer to go, and a half-eaten cashew
    rounding up the total to 600 dollars, (baby) not a cent more,
    charge it to WRBB one oh four point
    
    [B]   [D#m]              [A]                            [B]   [D#m]              [A]
    nine! round it up one oh five                           nine! round it up one oh five
    [C#m]
    one oh four point                 
    [B]   [D#m]              [A]   [C#m]                    one oh four point 
    nine! round it up one oh five!                          nine! round it up one oh five!

    there were bags holding buckets made of boxes made of bins all
    stacked on her head hands nose and chin
    standing still as a scarecrow, my waiter my waiter
    overloaded, unexpected and i never forgave her
    for she moved for the door and off came her crown
    a landslide, manager's 600 down to 
    new alimony, you knew all our money goes to
    WRBB one oh four point
    
    [B]   [D#m]              [A]                            [B]   [D#m]              [A]
    nine! round it up one oh five                           nine! round it up one oh five
    [C#m]
    one oh four point                 
    [B]   [D#m]              [A]   [C#m]                    one oh four point 
    nine! round it up one oh five!                          nine! round it up one oh five!

    in the wolly's sandwich line, aki's pretty close to cryin,
    'cause a brood of hens around the bend are coming to a tragic end 
        [B]         [D#]    [E]
    she crushed them with her car
    while she was trying to double park (her car)
    she didn't think it'd be that hard (to double park her car)
    what was a flock of chickens doing on huntington ave?

    They were trying to make a change :/

    ++

    they clasped our hands
    and zipped em together
    you shit your pants
    unchained to whatever

    (wip)
