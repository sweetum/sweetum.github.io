put your sundress on, we're going to work
we're taking quantitative lovers to rake cash in the fields of dirt
pick up arnold palmer in your tinted limo
rushin to a double feature of a hangover, the, talent show

so if i don't know
where i'm going
how do you?

if i can't make it out through the rain where you're pointing
