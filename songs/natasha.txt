    [F]
    there's a boy
                        [C7]
    letting his rattail grow
                            [G]
    and he's holding onto my banjo

    (same chords)
    there's a girl
    setting us all aglow
    she's only thinking about her pillow

    but they're not part of this song
    they both get their own songs
    and he can sing his own god damn song
    pretty well

    if i had to write her into this song
    we would probably run out of our alotted time
    pretty fuckin fast

    [F]
    killin time
                        [C7]
    watching the airplanes go
                                    [G]
    pilot's smokin out the window
    o rings of light

    start cryin
    watchin the engines 'splode
    cheerleaders lookin for trouble 
    feelin like natasha lyonne

    
    it's a wood's hole, it's a deep spring
    it's a box you put your money in
    it's boston massachussetts
