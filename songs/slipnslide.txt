    whole verse follows
    [Gmin7] [Gsus something] [F]

    (well, i used to)
    slip and slide from work every day
    no breaks, high stakes, i had to pay
    you back
    IOU

    (then i)
    saw her working at the corner store
    milk shake, two straws, room for one more
    sat down
    said hey

    (she said!)
    get down! things are gonna get ugly!
    i'm looking for a guy who owes me money!
    not me. . . . for once. . . .

    man walks in, he looks like a giant
    chest hair so bold that you could lion it 
    he was shirtless
    i should mention that..
