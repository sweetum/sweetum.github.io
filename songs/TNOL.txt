    don't let the people you write songs for
    [C]                 [Cm]
    know they're about them
    [A]             
    speaking of which
    [D]
    i really want you near me
    [C] 
    i want you so close, if you were any closer
            [C7]
    you'd be right behind me

    there goes the bell again
    time to get too much sleep
    that dosn't mean be well-rested
    it means get too much sleep
    
    oh, as our dance turns into a swaying hold
    i reach my arm to turn off the music
    it throws us off balance, the moment is ruined
    but the speaker keeps playing, the speaker still sounds like

    "you can sing, or so you say
                    [Gm7]           [Gdim?]
    you can make them lean in close
                        [Am7]   
    but you can't help me
        [Adim?]                    [Gm7]  [Gdim?]
    you can try, but you'll never love me"

    [A] [G#] [A] [F] [G] [A]

    (starting tempo)
    born in '68 into a tied-up elevator,
    i shimmied down the shaft, overeager for what comes later
    you're staring at my chin, i see defeat, bubbles rise, you lift your hand

    (faster)
    i'm wrapped around your pinky now, she's cognisant of what happened 
    when we slogged the crew down south into a den of laughs and childish
    fevers matching tempos kidsmoke drops the ball i'm chasing light until the
    bulls lower their horns and turn the siren on between us

    5. 6. 7. 8
    clap clap clap clap clap clap clap etc

    it's a risky time for searching in a field that's far too welcome 
    to a body or a skewer or at least someone who's held him
    close to making big decisions about phones and who's behind them
    in a rare and fragile state, i take a stab at setting fire to a pile

    (stacatto hits)

    [i live!] (i hope for so much longer)
    [i give!] (so i can go to heaven)
    [i die!] (curled on on the floor of a petstore)
    [i cry!] (curled on on the floor of a petstore  )

    i still need more to sate me, to elate me, consecrate me for the end

    [so if!] in a world that's far from perfect
    [that's it!] that's that, im PSH away
    [we've gone] to your house and explained our passions
    [to shit] after we've came

    around to the idea of a bloody anathema to a nonsensical scenario where i don't care to see ya!

    (stacatto movement, then horns let it fucking rip)
