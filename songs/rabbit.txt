        [B/Bb]       
        Irrational fear of centipedes and the number 5
        [F]
        I lied
        I’ll take the Greek salad
        [B/Bb]
        Geeked up and invalid 

        (pheasant bibulous sample)
        can you hear me? Hello? Someone’s coming…. Round the bend… ruff ruff! 
        Come brush your teeth… that’s okay, cause I’m with you

        [C E G F]

                [C]
        so we'll grasp close   
                                [F]
        and swing around the edges
        in time
                [F]
        down to the baiyou
        [Fm]
        (will we?)                  [C]
        well, i guess that's up to you

                                        [Em]
        you're afraid to pass the time
                                [G]
        can never tell the difference
        [F]                             [C]
        between you and and an endorphin rush

                [Em]
        hold me still
                        [F]
        i'm too drunk too much

        [Fm]
        ooh!

        (alternate lyrics)

        [C]                                  [Em]
        Mustard gas pangs inflect across the axis of time
                [F]
        Smiling bylines
        [Fm]
        Were they written by you
        [C]           [Em]
        Or a frank crocodile 
                                [G]
        I can never tell the difference 
        [F]                             
        Between you and an endorphin rush
        [C]        [Em]              [F]
        Dolphin blues and a mallet crush

        [Fm]
        Who
        Who
