    [B/Bb] 

    [F]      
    Irrational fear of centipedes 
    [B/Bb] 
    and the number 5
    [F]
    I lied
    I’ll take the Greek salad
    [B/Bb]
    Geeked up and invalid 

    (pheasant bibulous sample)
    can you hear me? Hello? Someone’s coming…. Round the bend… ruff ruff! 
    Come brush your teeth… that’s okay, cause I’m with you

    [C Em G F]

            [C]
    so we'll grasp close   
                            [Em ]
    and swing around the edges
    in time
            [F]
    down to the baiyou
    [Fm]
    (will we?)                  [C]
    well, i guess that's up to you

                                    [Em]
    you're afraid to pass the time
                            [G]
    can never tell the difference
    [F]                             [C]
    between you and and an endorphin rush

            [Em]
    hold me still
                    [F]
    i'm too drunk too much

    [Fm]
    ooh!

    (instrumental)
    [C Em G F]
    [C Em F Fm]

    [C]                                  [Em]
    Mustard gas pangs inflect across the axis of time
            [F]
    Smiling bylines
    [Fm]
    Were they written by you
    [C]           [Em]
    Or a frank crocodile 
                            [G]
    I can never tell the difference 
    [F]                             
    Between you and an endorphin rush
    [C]        [Em]              [F]
    Dolphin blues and a mallet crush

    [Fm]
    Who
    Who

    (instrumental)
    [C Em G F]
    [C Em F Fm]

    (outro)
