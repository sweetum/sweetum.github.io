            [C]
    so we'll grasp close   
                        [F]
    and swing around the edges
    in time
            [F]
    down to the baiyou
    [Fm]
    (will we?)                  [C]
    well, i guess that's up to you

                                [Em]
    you're afraid to pass the time
                        [G]
    can never tell the difference
    [F]                             [C]
    between you and and an endorphin rush

            [Em]
    hold me still
                    [F]
    i'm too drunk too much

    [Fm]
