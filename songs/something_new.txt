life's not short, but it's still time for me to find my way home
life's not short at all, but i still desire a home
swimmin naked with strangers, under the light of the moon
thank god for flaccid penises, i've got no length to bemoan

cannes grand prize winner, heartbreaking masterpiece
painting of h. jon ben staring at my feet
are you happy in the desert? do you wish you had a city on your block?
