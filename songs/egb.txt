 
    [D] [G] x2
                  [Bm]
    oh, well, aye aye
    [D]         [G]
    i've got it made
        [Bm]           [D]      [G]
    in a 24-hour post-symbiotic state
                    [Bm]
    can't catch your eye
    [D]               [G]
        can't catch a break
        [Bm] 
    but at least i got this 
    [D]             [G]
    nifty new keychain

        [A]     [A7]
    and lately
              [Bm]                [D]           [G]
    i've been feeling my body is heavier than my mind
            [A]     [A7]
    and lately 
             [F#]               [G]        [Gm]
    i've been wishing you were mine

        [D]  [G]
    aye aye
    you've got it wrong
    i'm just jokin
    (gimme dat)

    (same chords for verse 2)

    i wish you'd call
    just to say hey!
    dishwashing job in old big pine CA (so far away!)
    i know i'm old
    it's in my face
    my wrinkled eyes and laughs betray my age

    and lately
    i've been feeling my body is heavier than my mind
    oh, baby
    i've been wishing you were mine
    i've been wishing you were mine
    i've been praying, eating, breathing, cussing, screaming, wishin you were
    miiiiiiiiiiiiiine

        [D]  [G] x2
    aye aye
    

    [tennessee politics]

    (final verse)
    but i think you mind
    when i'm away 
    wish i'd walk my bike across the u.s.a
    so come alive
    i'll stay awake
    we'll whisper on and on in our own way

    'cause lately
    i've been feelin my body is heavier than my mind
    oh, baby
    i've been wishing you were mine
    i've been wishing you were mine
    i've been praying, fighting, drinking, fucking, screaming, wishin you were
    miiiiii
    iiiii
    iiiiii
    iiiiiiine
