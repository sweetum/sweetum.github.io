    [E]
    i dream about a supermarket, and a railroad tracking farrrrr behind it.
    i wrangled two tickets, one for you and one for allllll your luggage.

    [F#min7]                         [E]
    you crack a painful smile and draw an ichthus on my hand,
           [F#min7]                          [E]
    i make one last stupid joke about never taking a shower again
    [F#min7]                    [G#min]      
    a twinkle in your eyes, a puzzled expression
               [A]
    you say, "again?"

    (taryn) don't let me get away from you, but don't hold me aaaaaany closer
    (arch) and i always say i love you when you leave, in case of faaaaalling pianos

    (taryn) you said if heaven's gonna be worth it, better have a Wawa with a halo  
    (archi) and Bill Hader once told me i should try taking a date to see Salo
    (taryn) but i think Your joke was funnier, because you didn't do it for the money
    (archi) i did it to make you laugh

    ** 

    (archi) I love the mouse, I love the trees, I love ACHOO! excuse me, please, 
    i love the way you wear that lacy blouse, the summers that you spend down south

    Cuz I care so much about you
    I care so much about you

    I love the beaches and the creatures and a night of double features 
    i love everything about politics especially the levers

    Cuz it all reminds me of you
    everything reminds me of you

    i love meetings and appointments, i'm afraid i left my ointment out
    shut the fuck up i need to think about how to put this best, 
    oh please come home..... 
                
                一二三四 我爱你的
    i love the scratches and the matches and the couches that we crashes
                五六七八 你爱我的
    love the pumpkin and the pumpernickel, shut the fuck up oh my god

    are you fucking kidding me?
    oh my god

    i love your tits i love your ass i love your dick i love you're fat
    i love the way you grab my snout when we GO DOWN ON EACH OTHER!
                    verse! chorus! verse! chorus!
                bridge! chorus! outro! outro!
                outro ! outro! outro! outro!!!

    (feels good. . )



    i'm comin home
    and you're comin home
    x4

    back to. . . new jersey (repeat)

    'scuse me mister, could you spare a dime, so i can call my love?
    he's funny lookin, don't tell him that, and he's always thinking of a
    place
    where we
    can go 
    to be
    ten percent more touchy
    with each other
