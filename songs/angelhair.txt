i dream about a supermarket, and a railroad tracking farrrrr behind it.
i wrangled two tickets, one for you and one for allllll your luggage.

so you clasp your favorite pen, and draw an ichthus on my hand, 
i make one last stupid joke about never showering again

            a twinkle in your eyes, a puzzled expression
                        you say,
                            "again?"

don't let me get away from you, but don't hold me aaaaaany closer
and i always say i love you when you leave, in case of faaaaalling pianos

you said if heaven's cool, it better have a Wawa with a halo  
and Bill Hader once told me I should try taking a date to Salo
but i think Your joke was funnier
because you didn't do it for money
 
I love the mouse, I love the trees, I love ACHOO! excuse me, please, 
I love the way you wear that lacy blouse, the hillside climb up to your house

Cuz I care so much about you
I care so much about you

I love the beaches and the creatures and a night of double features 
i love everything about politics especially the fevers

i love the pumpkin and the pumpernickel,
