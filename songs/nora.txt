    i don't know why, darling
    i don't know why
    but something
    is wrong

    i don't know why, nora
    you won't tell me why
    something
    is wrong

    so when you
        when you
            when you
                don't come home

    we kiss you
        we hug you
            we tell you 
                we love you
                    and you're gone

    I tried to pry in your
    beautiful mind
    but the shine of your eyes
    left me blind

    well, one day nora, she said to me
    said i think it's time i set my sails to sea
    i said ok, ok, now darling. . . let's not be hasty
    her eyes gleamed dark, the whole study shook
    as she swept her arms 'cross my parenting books -- 
    i was begging for my life back then, it's not just the hook    

    (one run of chords with howling instrumentals)

    i sprint to the door, i say, "NORA, DON'T GO!"
    and she jukes me out before slamming the fly
    so i follow suit, ready to plead, but she interrupts me

    [SHOULD MY PATH BE A POINT, UNCHARTED LIFE
    I'D FLICK MY FORKED TONGUE 'CROSS A SERRATED KNIFE
    YOU COULD LOVE ME LIKE THE DAY YOU MET ME -- HOSPITALIZED]

    i say
    HOW
    DO
    YOU KNOW
    WHAT YOU'RE DOING

    NORA
    IM
    SO
    MOTHER
    FUCKING
    SCARED
        
    ++
    
    you don't trust me
    and i don't like that

    you don't trust us, nora, but we still love you!


    THEN I (keL) SHRED CLUCK OL HEN:
