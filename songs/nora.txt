    i don't know why, darling
    i don't know why
        [C]         
    but something
        [G]
    is wrong

    [G]
    i don't know why, nora
    i don't know why
        [C]         
    but something
        [G]
    is wrong

    cuz,
    [F]
    when you
        when you
            when you
                [G]
                wander home

    we
    [F]
    kiss you
            we hug you
                we tell you 
                    we love you
    [G]
    then you go

    [G]
    I tried to pry in your
    beautiful mind
            [C]
    but the shine of your eyes
                [G]
    left me blind

    [G]
    feelings aside, nora
    you've bled us dry
        [C]
    but at least we can say that we
        [G]
    tried

    so,
    [F]
    when you
        when you
            when you
                [G]
                don't come home

    we'll
    [F]
    kiss you
            we'll hug you
                we'll tell you 
                    we love you
    [G]
    then we'll go

    [G]
    well, one day nora, she said to me
    i think it's time you let me roam free
    [C]                                [G]
    i said ok, ok ok, darling. . . let's not be hasty
    
    [G]
    she shot right up and the whole room shook
    it's bound to happen, but sure hard to look
    [C]                                         [G]
    there's no snake oil more slimy than a parenting book

    i ran to the door, said, "NORA, DON'T GO!"
    she juked me out and slammed the fly
    i said think about it, nora, please, what you're doing to me

    she said, if i wanted to stay home, i'd lick a knife
    i'd be bedridden, reliant, for the rest of my life
    you could love me, static, as you met me, hospitalized!



        
    ++
    -->
    
    you don't trust me
    and i don't like that

    you don't trust us, nora, but we still love you!


    THEN I (keL) SHRED CLUCK OL HEN:
