    intro:

    [B] [A] x8   [E] x 4

            [E]
    i got lost 
                                [G#m]
    but you should. . . stick around
    [G#m -> F#m walkdown]                       [B] 
    ‘cause they’re filming a new big dig all around downtown (oh oh)
            [E]
    he got soft (he got soft!)
                    [G#m]
    but it wasn't his fault (no it wasn't his fault!)
    [G#m -> F#m walkdown]                   Gmaj7       [B] 
    and he promised this had never happened before      (oh god. . . i’m sorry) 

    ++

    [B    Bb     A]
    i'll 'rive at her place
        [E]
    no sex excess success
        [A]                                                [E]
    in a little green dot we threw up on and called our home 
        [A]                                        [Am]
    a plaid skirt smothered your eyelids, and you came
                            [E]
    an arm's length from heaven

    ++

                    [B]                     
    (but) when the night time comes and it’s you or the others
                    [A]
    we’re speaking like we’re friends but mother don’t bother
            [B]
    watch a car spinning out, shouting cool for the summer
            [A]
    as we're taking little bites of our collegiate lovers
                [B]                                             [A]
    aaaand i’m shaking my hips as i watch the years go by    (21 22 23!)
                [B]                                                     [A]
    she’s counting her tips as the boys race to say hiiiii      (kill the boy. kill the boy 
                                                                                                in the green tie.)
    ++    

    [E] x 4 

    ++

                [E]
    hand josh the map
                        [G#m]
    he loves giving directions 
    [G#m -> F#m walkdown]
    what was right, went left
                        [B]
    jersey slide, two frets
            [E]                                            
    i said, “where are we going, man? where are you taking us?” 
                [G#m]
    he didn’t answer — you said,
    [G#m -> F#m walkdown]                         Gmaj7
    “it’s a place full of lover lovers, they fuck for a cause, 
            [B]                                        [B]  [Bb] [A]
    and they told me that we should join them, do you think so too?” 

    ++
            [A]                                             [E]
    at the same spots, we’re all sixteen, but everyone’s thirty now
            [A]                                 [E]
    it makes sense, it’s what our parents did before us.
            [A]                                 [Am]
    if you find it too hard to forgive her, lend it time
                                        [E]
    in a few short years, we’ll all be gone. 

    ++

                    [B]
    so with your lungs filling up in the scarlet school colors, 
        [A]
    you take a look back, notice none of it matters
        [B]
    in a week, there's a wake, in another another, 
        [A]
    we’ve moved on to the boy from the live-action Heathers
            [B]                                             [A]
    and i’m shaking my hips as i watch the years go by      (24 25 26)
        [B]                                                    [A]
    i'm still in this fucking shirt, but the tips are running dry    (lemme see it, lemme see it lemme see it now)
