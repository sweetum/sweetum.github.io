roxbury heights

    i ain't made for workin'
    i got a feeble heart
    it demands constant reassurance when we're apart
    so it's not a country song,
    i couldn't live that far from you
    or the city where you run an urban farm

    i sit
    down by the railroad
    where you got all your crops
    an intersecting grid of flora box-
    es suppose i visit, bothered
    barefoot on the hot sidewalk
    broken glass & fertilizer line Tremont
    'til the sun goes down
    and you climb the hill into my loving arms

    and i'll miss you
    when i leave you
    in the same way i already miss you when you're around
    sprinkler morn-dew    
    might as well do
    the same thing we've been doing, just on the ground
    (repeat)

    'cause i can't stand
