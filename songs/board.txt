    oh well, aye aye
    i've got it made
    in a 24-hour post-symbiotic state

    can't catch your eye
    can't catch a break
    at least i got this nifty new keychain

    i wish you'd call
    just to say (hey)
    dishwashing job in ole' big pine, CA (so far away!)

    is it 'cause i'm old?
    is it in my face?
    my wrinkled idle hands betray my age
