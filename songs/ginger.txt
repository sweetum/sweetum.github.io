                    [A]
    when we tried to talk
                      [Bmin]
    we said all of our words
                   [C#min]                          [D]
    you poured out everything and more that i could fathom
    a human being could hold
        [A]
    and yet
                        [Bmin]
    the harbor was too deep
       [C#min]
    we crossed our arms and kicked our legs
          [D]
    and i bit down on everything you said
        [A]   [Bmin]  [C#min]  [D]
    and so it goes x2
         [A]
    baby, wait!
                        [Bmin]
    i'm on my hands and knees
            [C#min] 
    i'll chew up the dregs of the meat you shred
         [D]
    and throw up everything else i'm fed
    okay, there we go!
