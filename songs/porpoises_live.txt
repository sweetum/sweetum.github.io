    [B]                 [A] 
    aki walked into a supermarket shop, you know,
    [E]                             [E]     [A]
    the ones that sell fruit in a self-serve cup
    they took a look at her cart, screamed, and rang the bell
    it was an all-hands-meeting staffed by neer-do-wells
    she got 36 pies, arnold palmer to go, and a half-eaten cashew
    rounding up the total to 600 dollars, (baby) not a cent more,
    charge it to WRBB one oh four point                   


    [B]   [D#m]              [A]                            
    nine! round it up one oh five                          
    [C#m]
    one oh four point                 
    [B]   [D#m]              [A]   [C#m]                    
    nine! round it up one oh five!    
    
    there were bags holding buckets made of boxes made of bins all
    stacked on her head hands nose and chin
    standing still as a scarecrow, my waiter my waiter
    overloaded, unexpected and i never forgave her
    fore she moved for the door four off came her crown
    a landslide, manager's seldom downtown 
    new alimony, you knew all our money goes to
    WRBB one oh four point

    [B]   [D#m]              [A]

    [B]   [D#m]              [A]   [C#m]                    
    nine! round it up one oh five!

    in the wolly's sandwich line, aki's pretty close to crying
    'caus a pair of tens around the bend have come into a tragic end

    [B]             [D#m]     [E]
    she truck them with her car
    while she was trying to double park (her car)
    she didn't think it would be that hard (to double park (her car))

    what was a pair of tens doing on huntington avenue?
    they were trying to make a change.

    [B]    [D#maj7]     [E] (hold)
    they clasped our hands
                        [B] [A]     [E]
    and zipped em together

    you tore your dress

    on nails made of leather

    but either way, i won't be long now -- we gotta go to hell

    'cause we got no future

    and we got no past
