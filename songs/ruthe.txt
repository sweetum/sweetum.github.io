        [G]
it's a heart
[B7]
a day
    [Em]
my love
                [Am]    [Am7]  
is eating you away
[C]                         [G]
like an apple rotten to the core
[B7]
i do
[Em]
i do
                    [Am]    [Am7]
i'm guaranteed to pass
[C]
through
[Dmaj7]
oo
[G]
you
[G/F#]
a way
[Em]
a dove
                [C]
is roothing at a bark

[G]             [G/F#]
a painting of a star
        [Em]
floating by
                        [C]
waiting for the proper lark

[G] [C7]
blasting ob's at the met
like an uninvited scene partner

if i try
to make 
a change
i'll turn the other way
