 
    when you’re let down it feels like you’ve only even been let down before
    when you feel okay it feels like nothing’s ever mattered less to you

    when you feel sick you feel like you’re gonna be bedridden forever
    when you feel healthy you put yourself in danger to prove it’ll be like this forever

    when you’re scared 
    of going home
    when you’re scared
    of not being alone

    when you run
            B
    i’ll race next to you

    Bb
    when you hide
            B
    i’ll count and find you

    if you can't handle everything they got
    i won't pile any more on
