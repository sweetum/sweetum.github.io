tickets in the rain

yellow ticket on the dash
pay by phone or mail with cash
they didn't know that we had ended things today or I would ask you
can you believe they still give tickets in the rain
I'll restart my count of steps
i wish it were more complex than saying you didn't feel the same
can you believe they still give tickets in the rain
i remember on the lawn
looking at you for too long
while you were cleaning off my glasses
impending grass stains on our asses
and i guess things were going better then
when i could ask you can you believe they still give tickets in the rain
to the parking meter bloke
is this some sadistic joke
you can expect a world of pain
can you believe they still give tickets in the rain
