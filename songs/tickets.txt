    yellow ticket on the dash
    pay by phone or mail with cash
    they didn't know that we had ended things today or I would ask you
    can you believe they still give tickets in the rain

    I'll restart my count of steps
    i wish it were more complex than saying you didn't feel the same
    can you believe they still give tickets in the rain

    i remember on the lawn
    looking at you for too long (pause)

    while you were cleaning off my glasses
    impending grass stains on our asses
    and i guess things were going better then
    when i could ask you 
    
    can you believe they still give tickets in the rain

    to the parking meter bloke
    is this some sadistic joke?
    you can expect a world of pain
    
    can you believe they still give tickets in the rain
