i think your lighter is cool
but in the light of the day
i think it's silly that you keep it opaque
as if it's never going away

(aki back in)
you brought your lighter to school
as though it gave you a say
in whether we should talk about the whether
or just sit and get wet in the rain

[F]             [C]             [G]
or just sit and get wet in the rain
or just sit and get wet in the rain

there’s a boy
you should help him
cuz he’s feeling real sick
you should help him
you should help him
someone really should help him
                    [Em]            [F]
					he’s gone, he’s gone, he’s gone, he’s gone
					someone told him to turn around
					so he did

[C]             
there’s a boy
in a meadow
but he thought it was a stream
his mother was a teacher
but he was kinda dumb
                    [Em]            [F]
					he’s gone, he’s gone, he’s gone, he’s gone
					i listened to the voice, you know what i saw,
					he’s gone

[C]             
there's a boy at a dance
but he's not dancing
he's wearing a tailored suit
but it doesn't really suit him
                    [Em]            [F]
					he’s gone, he’s gone, he’s gone, he’s gone
					someone told him to turn around
					so he did

[C]
there’s a boy, at a dance
he’s crying in a stall
he fancied himself a stag
thought he’d grow him some horn
                    [Em]            [F]
					he’s gone, he’s gone, he’s gone, he’s gone
					i listened to the voice, you know what i saw,
					he’s gone
