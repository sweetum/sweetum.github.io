[C]         [Em]      [G]
i saw your lighter today
[C]         [Em]      [G]
i saw your lighter in half
[C]         [Em]      
i saw your lighter in full,
            [B7]
because you left
        [C]         [G]
and it hangs at your waist

[C]         [Em]      [G]
i saw your lighter in you
[C]         [Em]      [G]
i saw your lighter again
[C]         [Em]      
i saw your lighter with a serrated knife
    [F]    [C]         [G]
into twenty thousand pieces of glass

[F]             [C]             [G]
twenty thousand pieces of glass
twenty thousand pieces of glass 

i think your lighter is cool
but in the light of the day
i think it's silly that you keep it opaque
as if it's never going away

you brought your lighter to school
as though it gave you a say
in whether we should talk about the whether
or just sit and get wet in the rain

[F]             [C]             [G]
or just sit and get wet in the rain
or just sit and get wet in the rain
