	i think your lighter is cool
	but in the light of the day
	i think it's silly that you keep it opaque
	as if it's never going away

	(orch back in)
	you brought your lighter to school
	as though it gave you a say
	in whether we should talk about the whether
	or just sit and get wet in the rain

	[F]             [C]             [G]
	or just sit and get wet in the rain
	or just sit and get wet in the rain
	or just sit and get wet in the rain

						[Em]            [F]
			he’s gone, he’s gone, he’s gone, he’s gone
			someone told him to turn around
			so he did

	[C]             
	there’s a boy
	in a meadow
	but he thought it was a stream
	his mother was a teacher
	but he was kinda dumb
						[Em]            [F]
			he’s gone, he’s gone, he’s gone, he’s gone
			i listened to the voice, you know what i saw,
			he’s gone

	[C]             
	there's a boy at a dance
	but he's not dancing

						[Em]            [F]
			he’s gone, he’s gone, he’s gone, he’s gone

	there's a boy in all of us
	it's true
	there's a boy in me
	there's a boy in you
	and he'll stick around
	for as long as it takes

	there's a boy, he's tall, he can't go under bridges
	or maybe he's short, [no kingdaka]
	and he's gone
	that one, oooh, snap. outta here

	he only came around here 'cause he loves you
	you didn't say bye when he left, because you love him
	now he's gone
	never even asked him for his name, but it was john.
