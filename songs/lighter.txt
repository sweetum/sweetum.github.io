i saw your lighter today
i saw your lighter in half
i saw your lighter in full,
because you left
and it hangs at your waist

i saw your lighter in you
i saw your lighter again
i saw your lighter with a serrated knife
into twenty thousand pieces of glass

[F]             [G]             [C]
twenty thousand pieces of glass
twenty thousand pieces of glass

i think your lighter is cool
but in the light of the day
i think it's silly that you keep it opaque
as if it's never going away
