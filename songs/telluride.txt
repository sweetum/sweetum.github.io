life's not short, but it's time for me to find my way home
[C]                                               [G]

[B7]                                [C]                                 [G]
swimmin naked with some strangers, 'til we're not, under the light of the moon
[A7]                    [C]                           [G]
glad i got a flaccid penis, 'cause it means i got no length to bemoan (and also it would be weird)

[C]                                                         [G]
cannes grand prize winner, heartbreaking masterpiece, (or so they say)

[B7]                                [C]                                 [G]
are you happy in the desert? do you wish you had a city on your block?
[A7]                    [C]                           [G]

[G]                 [A]

        [C]                         [G]

            [G]                     [A]                             [C]    [D]
you've been up since six, i'm just worried you won't find your way home
            [G]                 [A]
is it the druid, you've been visiting?
        [C]                     [G]
or the smart chick college of legends
[F]                         [Em]                     [D]

[C]                                                         [G]

[C]                                               [G]
with a toothbrush in my pocket and the rest of my shit piled in the trunk
[B7]                                [C]                                 [G]
put six dollars on the counter when the lady with the tats hit a backflip
[A7]                    [C]                           [G]

at the nut store, hands full of cherries but i'm staring at maps

[G]                                             (riff)          [C]
jordan with a glint in her eye, tells me oh, she won't miss it
rose with a flick of a lash, tells me oh, she won't miss it
cherry with a wish of a smile, tells me honey, she won't miss it.

so while your great-grand-daddy's greying eagle's swooping closer to midnight
i'll be singing my stupid stolen song about a corpse in a bar fight
                [Fm]                                                  [C]        [C7]
my disgusting fucking shoes up on the dash using vince as a taxi
singing prayers for the bolt action cow bleeding out in your backseat
