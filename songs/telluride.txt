life's not short, but it's still time for me to find my way home
life's not short at all, but i still desire a home
swimmin naked with strangers, under the light of the moon
thank god for flaccid penises, i've got no length to bemoan

cannes grand prize winner, heartbreaking masterpiece, or so they say
i've got a painting of h. jon ben staring at my feet
are you happy in the desert? do you wish you had a city on your block?
no, i bet it feels better, like a kitty with its legs in a sock

[G]                 [A]
telluride, are you listenin'?
        [C]                         [G]
are your feet like mine, are they glistenin?

you've been up since six, i'm just worried you won't find your way home
is it the druid, you've been visiting?
or the smart chick college of legends

i'm at flashdancer's now, but not the one from the ad on the taxi
with a toothbrush in my pocket and the rest of my shit piled in the backseat

put a dollar on the counter when the lady with the tats hit a backflip
i would've spent more, but i was nervous and afraid she was miss it


jordan with a glint in her eye, tells me oh, she won't miss it
rose with a flick of a lash, tells me oh, she won't miss it
jordan with a glint in her eye, tells me oh, she won't miss it

annie other as outro


but your great-grand-daddy's owl still flies at midnight
