i want a new baby
and i want him to walk my way
doo doo doo
unlike you
shadooba
shabooda
ascuba
a slippery day

i got a new jersey
and baby you can wear it too
doo doo doo
if you choose
(scatting)
don't worry
i'm neurotic too

he's gotta be short
and cute and tall
he's gotta have arms that can clamber over walls
and i wouldn't mind at all
if he set his own standards for me

he's gotta have legs that are clocked in horsepower
and a certain kind of penchant to join me in the shower
but with all that and more, he'll maybe get to hear me sing
that
i

want a new baby!
and i want him to walk my way
doo doo doo
unlike you
shadooba
shabooda
ascuba
a slippery day

i got a new jersey
and baby you can wear it too
doo doo doo
if you choose
(scatting)
don't worry
i'm neurotic too
