    a slippery day

    i got a new jersey
    and baby you can wear it too
    rut dut doo
    if you choose
    a 26 emblazoned on my back to remind me of you

                    [Dm7]
    he's gotta be short
                [G7]
    and cute and tall
                [C7]                            [A7]
    he's gotta have arms that can clamber over walls
    and i wouldn't mind at all
    if he kept those same standards for me

    he's gotta have legs that are clocked in horsepower
    and a certain kind of penchant to join me in the shower
    but with all that and more, he'll maybe get to hear me sing
    that

    and i want him to like my face
    doo doo doo
    unlike you
