a slippery day

i got a new jersey
and baby you can wear it too
doo doo doo
if you choose
(scatting)
don't worry
i'm neurotic too

                [Dm7]
he's gotta be short
            [G7]
and cute and tall
            [C7]                            [A7]
he's gotta have arms that can clamber over walls
and i wouldn't mind at all
if he set his own standards for me

he's gotta have legs that are clocked in horsepower
and a certain kind of penchant to join me in the shower
but with all that and more, he'll maybe get to hear me sing
that
i

want a new baby!
and i want him to walk my way
doo doo doo
unlike you

a slippery day

i got a new jersey
and baby you can wear it too
doo doo doo
if you choose
