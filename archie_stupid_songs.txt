When You're
    when you’re let down it feels like you’ve only even been let down before
    when you feel okay it feels like nothing’s ever mattered less to you

    when you feel sick you feel like you’re gonna be bedridden forever
    when you feel healthy you put yourself in danger to prove it’ll be like this forever

    when you’re scared 
    and go back home
    when you’re scared
    of not being alone 

    when you run
    i’ll race next to you

    when you hide
    i’ll count and find you

    when you’re scaaaaared

Margola

    [C]
    if you don't, take it slow
    the starboard boom be a bloody blow

    [D7/D#]         [D#7/E] 
    and it sure ain't safe to swim

    Over, under, torn asunder
    sailor surrender, was a boring blunder

    [D7/D#]         [D#7/E] 
    got our sticks and sacks
        [G7] [C]
    it's fine, i warned her
    
    [C]
    as we mope, along the road,
    a big gust of wind blows us overboard

    [D7/D#]         [D#7/E] 
    and the highway's got some teeth
        [G7] [C]
    kel told me so

    [C]
    scrapped and scraped, zipped and zapped
    light white bags filled with all our crap

    [D7/D#]         [D#7/E] 
    holler down that tunnel
            [G7] [C]
    i'll take the raft

    [C]
    floating right burning bright
    said margola sinking into the night

    [D7/D#]         [D#7/E] 
    it's fire above, below
        [G7]   [C]
    kel told me so
