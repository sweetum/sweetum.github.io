When You're
    when you're let down
    when you're let down
    you feel like you've only ever been let down before

    when you're okay
    when you're okay
    it feels like nothing ever gets better than that

    (riff however many times)

    when you feel sick
    when you feel sick
    it's like you're going to be bedridden forever

    but when you're healthy
    when you're healthy
    you put yourself in danger, to prove you'll live forever

    (riff however many times)

    so when you're scared
    of being alone
    and when you're scared
    of not being alone

    when you're hiding
    i'll come find you
    and when you're running
    i'll remind you

    that i care


Kim
