hips pt.2

notes:
    hips pt.1
        need to arrange a specific part for jon

    natasha
        just need to practice and figure out the form better

    margola
        should play it slightly faster than we did
        need to specifically arrange horns on i know i know i know etc
        end instrumental: horns should not be playing mid-range pads, should be playing high range staccato
        looping lines, mid range is already very full with guitar keys cello
            a la track x bcnr, appalachian fiction, glassworks
        
    lighter
        archie finish lyrics
        finishing with a caleb solo is very good
    
    angel
        horns should be padding once the beat drops on fast end before going into arranged part then back to padding
        horns need better specific arrangement for 'im going home' etc sectino
        tambourine on 16th notes on fast end, caleb on a percussion part too? traingle?

    ank 
        off-timing horn arrangement to be done for end instrumental
    
    hips pt. 2 & 3
        no horn padding on 'we all keep talking' verse, then come in with the motif after a loop
        we should jam on pt 3 for some time to get looser with it, right now it feels like we're
            all following each other back and forth, we should all be somewhat in our own world
        should try to come back in without a drum cue during sax interlude
