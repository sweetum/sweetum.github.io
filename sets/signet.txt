11/6 practice notes (scattered & rushed)
+ general
    i fuck with lighter a lot. great! broke the new song curse that doesn't actually exist but was always in the back of my head, whatever
+ melody 
    no octaves on margola. figure out line you like, i think what we worked out has legs but not perfect, groove is pretty straightforward though. practice that and angel hair last two sections! w the licks we talked about. you've got nora in your bloodstream and 
+ jackson
    make sure to really hit the crash when we're doing a pickup transition like in angel hair or ank or margola or nora or uhh everything but lighter. really important to start out margola rock section with strong crash into solid hi hat groove. shift to 4 on the floor kick once you're on ride, keep the crash up. cut the cymbals on margola verse, the swing is so good on instrumental and even more fun if it's a shock
+ jonathan 
    sent guitar vid thing. make sure you're on top of the angel end line hooooome. once jackson and i start shouting numbers at each other feel free to go a lot crazier on sax
+ sneha 
    belt that shit out on lighter, only run tambourine when we're on the B part of Nora otherwise caleb shaker is enough percussion, sing nora with me loud af!
+ taryn
    i think you had lighter down but just listen to the recording anyway. make sure you've got your part for angel hair down too, you haven't run it too many times. i love the lick you play in margola end and i love having you close it
+ emma
    listen to Lighter on untitled and learn the two main lines!
+ archie
    figure out definitive guitar tone, restring telecaster
+ caleb
    don't come in with ank hits until words. feel free to blast around but not in an attention grabbing way while it's just guitar instrumental. then do the hits on ayuhuasca etc. shaker on margola intro, let's be chill about getting a groove going before we hop into it.
+ aki
    practice nora! i'd like you to be comfortable taking a solo on it. most likely not for this show, but hopefully by the end of this semester. it's just a G scale! figure out what you want to play for second half of Angel (fast and slowdown). maybe something slides ballsack esque
