NOTES:thanks

    general
    make sure horns are always mic'd up, not loud enough on their own
    get aki a new clip mic

    always play bar love. never kill yourself

        archie don't brick the form at the end. learn your fucking lyrics
        jackson make sure you're playing this beat:

        hat     x   x   x   x   
        snare       x       x   
        kick    x     x   x

        not this beat:
        hat     x   x   x   x   
        snare       x       x   
        kick    x       x

        see: ank alley from sweetums LIVES, valerie by amy winehouse 

        archie use electric guitar
        no horns at end, everyone on percussion

    margola
        need at least two horns to play this probably? just to get the canon loud enough. definitely our roughest song at this set just on the basis of both aki and caleb getting sonically fucked

    nora
        archie don't brick solo
        make sure keys are loud enough. veeery important lowkey


    angel hair 
        is a perfect song. tooooo newwww jerrrseyyyy

    bar love
        open interlude with the talking and then just the melody is cool. would be even cooler if archie had not played and it was just caleb.
        so beautiful.
        archie stop cutting everyone out during the pt 2 verses. it's cute but lmao
        after guitar interlude, horns come in playing the main motif but along the melody singing the same thing

setlist - 30min - archie catherine jackson aki sneha caleb
